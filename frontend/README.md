# Hope Frontend

React-based frontend for the Hope Platform - NYC homeless services directory.

## Tech Stack

- **React** 18.3.1
- **TypeScript** 4.9.5
- **React Leaflet** 4.2.1 - Interactive map with Carto tiles
- **React Leaflet Markercluster** 3.0.0-rc1 - Marker clustering for performance
- **i18next** 23.16.8 - Multi-language support (English, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, French, Russian, Haitian Creole)
- **Nominatim** - Geocoding and address search
- **react-google-recaptcha** - Form spam protection

## Features

### Dark Mode Support
The app supports both automatic and manual dark mode:
- **Light mode**: Carto Voyager map tiles, light UI elements
- **Dark mode**: Carto Dark Matter map tiles, dark UI elements

**Theme Toggle**: Users can manually switch between light and dark mode using the toggle button in the header. The preference is persisted in localStorage.

**Implementation**: The theme is managed via React Context (`ThemeContext.tsx`) which:
- Adds/removes `dark-mode` class on `<body>` for CSS targeting (used by Leaflet popups)
- Sets `data-theme` attribute on `<html>` for potential CSS variable usage
- Persists user preference to localStorage under key `theme-mode`
- Falls back to system preference (`prefers-color-scheme`) if no saved preference

## Development

### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Variables
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Required variables:
- `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` - Backend API URL (default: https://hopefornyc.com/api/v1)
- `REACT_APP_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` - Google reCAPTCHA v2 site key

### Run Development Server
```bash
npm start
```

Runs on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

Creates optimized production build in `build/` directory.

## Deployment

### Production Deployment Location

**IMPORTANT**: The frontend is served by Nginx from `/var/www/hope-frontend/`, NOT from `/home/opc/Hope/frontend/build/`.

To deploy the frontend after building:

```bash
# Build the frontend
npm run build

# Deploy to Nginx serving directory (requires sudo)
sudo rsync -av --delete /home/opc/Hope/frontend/build/ /var/www/hope-frontend/
```

### Nginx Configuration

The frontend is configured in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/hope-backend.conf`:

- **Static assets** (JS, CSS, images): Cached for 1 year with `Cache-Control: public, immutable`
- **HTML files**: Cached for 1 hour with `Cache-Control: public, must-revalidate`
- **Service worker**: No cache (`Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`)

### Deployment Checklist

1. Make changes to source code
2. Build: `npm run build`
3. Deploy: `sudo rsync -av --delete /home/opc/Hope/frontend/build/ /var/www/hope-frontend/`
4. Users should hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) to bypass browser cache

## Map Features

### Dark Mode Map Tiles
The map automatically switches between tile styles based on system theme:
- **Light mode**: Carto Voyager (streets + navigation style)
- **Dark mode**: Carto Dark Matter (dark themed map)

### Zoom Level Behavior

- **Zoom 0-7**: No markers shown (too zoomed out - state/country level)
- **Zoom 8-11**: Markers shown with clustering (numbered circles group nearby locations)
- **Zoom 12+**: Individual markers shown (no clustering)

This configuration balances performance with usability:
- Prevents loading all locations when viewing entire country/state
- Uses clustering to reduce visual clutter at city/metro level
- Shows individual markers when zoomed in to neighborhood level

### Marker Clustering

Implemented with `react-leaflet-markercluster`:
- `maxClusterRadius={50}` - Markers within 50px are clustered
- `disableClusteringAtZoom={12}` - Individual markers at zoom 12+
- `spiderfyOnMaxZoom={true}` - Spread out overlapping markers when fully zoomed
- `chunkedLoading` - Improves performance with large datasets

### Filter Bar

The map includes a two-row filter bar at the bottom of the screen:

**Top Row** (scrollable on mobile):
- **DHS Official** (yellow) - Opens informational card about NYC DHS intake process
- **Center Button** (🎯) - Centers map on user's current location
- **Open Now** - Filters to show only locations currently open
- **Open Today** - Filters to show locations open at any point today

**Category Row** (scrollable):
- Food (with sub-filters: Hot Meals, Groceries)
- Intake Center
- Drop-In Center
- Mental Health Crisis (with sub-filters: CPEP Emergency, Other Crisis)
- Youth Services
- Free WiFi & Charging
- Benefits & ID Help
- Case Management
- Hygiene
- Medical
- Hospitals
- Public Restrooms
- Warming Center
- Cooling Center
- DV Hotline (direct phone link)

Filters update the map in real-time by passing `service_types`, `open_now`, and `open_today` parameters to the backend API.

### DHS Information Card
Yellow "DHS Official" button opens an informational card with:
- NYC DHS intake locations and addresses
- Direct call links for 311 and Safe Horizon hotline
- Important warnings about the intake process

## Code Organization

### MapScreen Modularization
The main `MapScreen.tsx` was refactored from ~2000 lines into smaller, focused modules in `screens/map/`:

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `mapHelpers.ts` | Types (`ServiceLocation`, `ServiceType`), constants (`API_BASE_URL`, `KM_PER_MILE`), utility functions (icon creation, time formatting, phone validation) |
| `mapStyles.ts` | All dynamic styles via `getMapStyles(colors, isDark)` function |
| `DHSInfoCard.tsx` | DHS Safe Options overlay with intake locations and hotlines |
| `MapControls.tsx` | `MapEventHandler`, `MapCenterController`, `MarkerWithClick` components |
| `WeeklyHoursDropdown.tsx` | Expandable weekly hours display in popups |
| `index.ts` | Barrel exports for clean imports |

This structure improves maintainability while keeping the main `MapScreen.tsx` focused on rendering and state management.

## Performance Optimizations

### Frontend
1. **Marker Clustering**: Reduces DOM nodes from thousands to dozens at metro zoom levels
2. **Debounced Map Updates**: 400ms debounce prevents excessive API calls during pan/zoom
3. **Bounding Box Queries**: Only fetches locations visible in current viewport
4. **Viewport Caching**: Skips API call if viewport is within previously cached bounds
5. **Memoized Markers**: React.useMemo prevents unnecessary re-renders

### Backend Integration
The frontend integrates with optimized backend endpoints:
- `/api/v1/public/services/in-bounds` - Bounding box query with eager loading (1 SQL query instead of 226)
- Rate limited to 60 requests/minute per IP
- Redis-backed rate limiting across all uvicorn workers

## Language Support

Full internationalization (i18n) support:
- **English** (en) - Default
- **Spanish** (es) - Espanol
- **Chinese** (zh) - 中文
- **Arabic** (ar) - العربية (RTL layout)
- **French** (fr) - Francais
- **Russian** (ru) - Русский
- **Haitian Creole** (ht) - Kreyol Ayisyen

Language switcher in header with flag icons. Translations stored in `public/locales/{lang}/translation.json`.

```bash
# API Configuration
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://hopefornyc.com/api/v1

# Google reCAPTCHA v2 Configuration
REACT_APP_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=your-recaptcha-site-key-here
```

## Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## Known Issues

### Browser Caching
Due to aggressive browser caching of JavaScript assets (1-year cache), users may need to hard refresh after deployments:
- **Chrome/Edge/Firefox**: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- **Safari**: Cmd+Option+R
- **Or**: Open Developer Tools (F12) -> Right-click refresh -> "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

The HTML index file has a shorter cache (1 hour) and includes content-based hashes in asset filenames (e.g., `main.9c524db2.js`) which should trigger cache busts on changes, but some browsers may still cache aggressively.

## Security

- Content Security Policy (CSP) configured in Nginx
- HTTPS enforced (HTTP redirects to HTTPS)
- No sensitive data stored in frontend
- All API calls authenticated through CORS headers
- Permissions Policy restricts geolocation to self-origin only
- reCAPTCHA protects form submissions from spam
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration (not hardcoded)
