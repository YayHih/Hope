Architectural Overhaul & Feature Roadmap
1. Backend & Data Schema (FastAPI)
Goal: Move all logic to the server. The Frontend should be "dumb" and just render what it receives.

Action: Create a new Pydantic model (ServiceLocationPublic) that acts as the "Golden Object."

Computed Fields: Add icon_url, is_verified (bool), last_verified_text (str), and alert (obj).

Logic Migration: Port the getFoodSubCategory and getCrisisSubCategory logic from TypeScript (mapHelpers.ts) into Python properties on the model.

Alerts: Expose the temporary_closures table as an alert object on the location (e.g., { "color": "red", "msg": "Closed for Repairs" }).

Endpoint: Ensure /api/v1/public/services/all returns the full compressed list of ~4,000 locations for the initial sync.

2. Frontend Architecture (Vite + Offline-First)
Stack: Initialize new app with Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4.

"True Offline" Strategy:

On Load: Fetch the entire ~4MB location dataset (gzipped).

Storage: Persist this array to IndexedDB (via tanstack-query or idb-keyval).

Runtime: The Map, Search, and List views must read from this local array, not the API.

Search & Discovery:

Implement Fuse.js running on the local data array for instant, offline-capable fuzzy search (solving the "typo" problem).

Add a List View Toggle that maps the filtered local data to a simple card list (for Accessibility/Screen Readers).

3. Static Assets
Action: Generate static SVG/PNG files for every marker type (e.g., pin-soup-kitchen.svg, pin-shelter-open.svg).

Placement: Store in /public/markers/.

Usage: The backend icon_url field should point directly to these paths, removing the need for client-side SVG generation.
