    <p>Hope is a progressive web app aimed towrads connecting those without homes to all kinds of opportunities. <br><br> With Hope, one is able to effortlessly check the avalibly of shelters, stock of food kitchens and so much more.<br><br>
    Currently in the development phase, here at Hope, we are reaching out to our connections at the Salvation Army and various homelss shelters throughouth the city <br><br>
    At Hope we are not planning on gathering funds through monotization, but rather from grants and private donations<br><br>
    Once Hope becomes fully functional, we expect costs to average around 1-5k per month, coming from server and maintenance costs.
